# FishyPi case.

The case here was originally designed by DLLU and can be found at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4684807

I have changed parts to include the FishyPi logo and also to resize it so that it's not so deep.  The original was designed for the Official Pi HQ camera and a large lense, but I'm just using it with a wee M12 camera taped inside, so I was able to make it far shallower.

The benefit of this design is the cone allows it to be pushed against glass, cutting out reflections.

The STL files starting with "pi" are the original files.  My openscad files import these and alter them.  The STLs starting with "fishypi" are what I've ended up with and printed.
